Road to a Cube: Step 6

- Change vertex shader to accept a vec3 rather than vec2
- Change "rect" to "cube"
- Enable depth testing
- Enable backface culling
- Write cube coords to the vertex buffer
- Write cube indices to the index buffer
- Add 4 more colors to the color buffer
- Change vertexAttribPointer to use 3 floats at a time rather than 2
- Add a rotation to the cube so we can see more than one face
